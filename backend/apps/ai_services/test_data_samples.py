Pioneers of single-product delivery in Uzbekistan
    Digital platform
    Plovme is the first single—product digital platform in Uzbekistan specializing in the delivery of pilaf. We strive to change the food delivery market by offering our customers a unique experience focused on one of the most beloved Uzbek dishes. Our mission is to make pilaf affordable, tasty and convenient for everyone.

    Our business model
    Plovme is an innovative business model based on the concept of dark kitchens. We are creating a network of 148 such kitchens across the country, which are exclusively engaged in cooking pilaf for delivery. This allows us to control the quality at all stages and ensure the highest standard of the product.

    Savings and high profitability
    Investments in dark kitchens of Plovme can significantly reduce the cost of production. Low rental costs and the absence of visitors reduce prices and increase margins. The purchasing power of the company helps to reduce the cost by 30% compared to competitors.

    Full control over the process
    Plovme fully controls all stages of production — from the selection of ingredients to delivery. This helps us maintain a high standard of quality and respond promptly to customer needs.

    How do we reduce the cost of production
    The purchasing power of Plovme allows you to reduce costs by 30% thanks to volume purchases and long-term partnerships with suppliers, which makes our product competitive.

    A revolution in logistics
    Plovme uses a unique AI-based delivery system that allows couriers to complete up to 22 deliveries at one time, minimizing delays and increasing productivity.

    IT product development
    To increase efficiency, we develop our own IT solutions that help manage orders, logistics and service quality. Our platform guarantees the accuracy of delivery and a high level of customer service.

    High average check
    Plovme focuses on the delivery of orders from 5 servings, which stimulates group orders and increases the average receipt, allowing us to offer competitive prices.

    Plans and prospects
    By 2026, Plovme plans to deliver 1 million servings of pilaf daily. We also plan to produce more than 1,000 tons of pilaf per day, which confirms our ambitions to scale the business.

    Ambitious goals
    We aim to achieve unicorn status with an estimated value of over $1 billion by 2026. Our ambitions make the project attractive to investors who want to participate in successful growth and development.

    Holding and diversification
    Plovme is already a holding company with eight companies covering courier delivery, dark kitchen construction and other business lines, which helps us to remain flexible and efficient.
